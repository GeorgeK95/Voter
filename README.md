# Voter
ReactJs fundamentals course project.

Voter is simple voting spa and "infinity scroll" app where users can register and create polls with min 2 and up to 6 options to vote.
Only logged users can create poll and vote for one.
Logged users also have profile page, where all created by user polls and all votes by user polls are listed.
Voter has admin functionality: the admin can remove polls if they contain uncensored content and also can ban users.
A user that is banned can't sign up anymore but its not deleted from db so we dont lose votes.
There are also tag and search functionality where we can add tags to any poll and then filter polls we want by tags.
Voter will be deployed as soon as i get free.
